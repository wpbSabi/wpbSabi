## Welcome - Check out my repositories: 
- My most recent project was a [sustainable supply chain template](https://github.com/wpbSabi/sustainable_supply_chain_template) which utilizes geocoding,  geospatial calculations, mapping with folium, and sustainability metrics to create a supply chain template that accounts for both transportation and facility greenhouse gas emissions (rather than only one or the other).
- The Python Optimization repo includes supply chain models and other optimization models
  - [Oregon Districts](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/oregon_districts) is a project in anticipation of 2020 Census data with an accompanying [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-draw-congressional-districts-in-python-with-linear-programming-b1e33c80bc52)
  - [Seasonal Inventory](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/seasonal_inventory) is a multi-period inventory model with capacity constraints
  - [Facility Location](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/facility_location) is a simple supply chain example combining optimization with geospatial visualization of the results
  - [Minimum Cost Flow](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/minimum_cost_flow) is a supply chain model that chooses the optimal transportation lanes
- The Geospatial repo includes maps with folium, geopandas, plotly, kepler, and/or other packages
  - [Portland Districts](https://github.com/wpbSabi/portland_potential_districts) is an analysis utilizing census tract data to explore a few districting options for Portland's first potential city council districts
  - [Montavilla Grocery Stores](https://github.com/wpbSabi/geospatial/tree/main/montavilla) displays folium capabilities while exploring grocery store locations in East Portland
  - [Covid Deaths](https://github.com/wpbSabi/geospatial/tree/main/one_in_covid_deaths) uses geopandas to make choropleth maps of the World and the US around the time when 1 in 500 people in the US had died due to Covid [(article)](https://sabolch-horvat.medium.com/1-in-500-in-the-us-have-died-from-covid-1-in-1700-in-the-world-have-as-of-september-18th-2021-c0de1bf37028)
  - [Oregon Covid-19](https://github.com/wpbSabi/oregon-covid-19) contains additional charts about Covid-19 from when I wanted to know more about how the virus was spreading near me.
- [Weather](https://github.com/wpbSabi/weather) has multiple Historical Weather Data Analysis with R and python
  - See articles on [Towards Data Science](https://medium.com/@sabolch-horvat/about)
  - I plan to update images for Portland, Oregon after the first freeze in 2022
- [Ducks](https://github.com/wpbSabi/ducks) Data analysis with R about how many eggs our ducks have laid in their two years

- 🚚 🚢 I work primarily on supply chain networks, but my github has a more diverse range of interests
- 🌱🌲🌳 My wife and I are gardeners and home orchardists; our ducks also help with permaculture aspects of our system 🐛🦆🥚.  For duck videos, please see our youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/gardeningwithducks
