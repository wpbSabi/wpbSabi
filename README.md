### Hi there, I'm Sabi 👋

## I'm a Data Scientist who strives to do good: 
- 🌱 I'm an environmentalist with a concern for sustainable living.
- 🌲 I live in Oregon, also known as heaven ☁️.
- 📓 I started writing for [Towards Data Science](https://medium.com/@sabolch.horvat) on Medium in 2021.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my third article for Towards Data Science, related to the Census.
- 💡 I love learning and sharing. My repositories and the ones I follow are intended for both of those purposes.

## Connect with me: 
- 🐦 On [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tourofdata).
- 😄 Pronouns: he / him / his
- 🌳 Fun fact: My wife and I are gardeners and home orchardists, respectively, and our ducks help with permaculture aspects of our system 🐛🦆🥚.

## Check out my repositories: 
- [Python Optimization](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization) includes supply chain models and the Census project mentioned above.
- [Machine Learning](https://github.com/wpbSabi/machine_learning) includes python scikit-learn models, such as a farmers market analysis and will soon contain projects about hazelnut trees and duck eggs.
- [Weather](https://github.com/wpbSabi/weather) includes Historical Weather Data Analysis with R; see my Towards Data Science article (link above).
- [Oregon Covid-19](https://github.com/wpbSabi/oregon-covid-19) contains additional charts about Covid-19 from when I wanted to know more about how the virus was spreading near me.
- [Oregon Voters](https://github.com/wpbSabi/oregon_voters) was some ad hoc analysis, with both R and Python, before the 2020 election based on voter registration data.  I tried to understand how things may or may not change in the local state elections.
- [Basketball](https://github.com/wpbSabi/basketball) is a R shiny app that I built to automate the analysis I typically do to guess with my March Madness picks. Additional analysis showed that my methods are not great at guessing the winners, but whose methods are?
