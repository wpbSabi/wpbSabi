## Welcome - To summarize my public github repositories: 
- These repositories are simple projects that serve as good references.  I do still share links to these repositories as examples when these topics come up in discussions.
- I don't have any machine learning models as public repositories at this time.
- Some of the repositories share optimization models that use open source (ortools or pulp rather than gurobi or cplex, etc.)

## About the repositories:
- I'm currently working on [weather_python](https://github.com/wpbSabi/weather_python), which focuses on weather data analysis in python and demonstrates some best practices.
- The [sustainable supply chain template](https://github.com/wpbSabi/sustainable_supply_chain_template) utilizes geocoding, geospatial calculations, mapping with folium, and sustainability metrics to create a supply chain template that accounts for both transportation and facility greenhouse gas emissions (rather than only one or the other).
- Python Optimization contains the following:
	- [Seasonal Inventory](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/seasonal_inventory) is a multi-period inventory model with capacity constraints. The model utilizes ortools pywraplp.
	- [Facility Location](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/facility_location) is a simple supply chain example combining optimization with geospatial visualization of the results.
	- [Minimum Cost Flow](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/minimum_cost_flow) is a supply chain model that chooses the optimal transportation lanes.
	- [Oregon Districts](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/oregon_districts) was a project in anticipation of 2020 Census data.  The project uses python optimization that is explained with an accompanying [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-draw-congressional-districts-in-python-with-linear-programming-b1e33c80bc52).
- [Ducks](https://github.com/wpbSabi/ducks) is data exploration, analysis, and metric development with R about how many eggs our ducks have laid.  
- The geospatial repository contains the following:
	- [One-in-covid-deaths](https://github.com/wpbSabi/geospatial/tree/main/one_in_covid_deaths) uses geopandas to visualize comparisons with choropleth maps.
	- [Montavilla Grocery Stores](https://github.com/wpbSabi/geospatial/tree/main/montavilla) displays folium's geospatial capabilities while exploring grocery store locations in East Portland.
- [Oregon Covid-19](https://github.com/wpbSabi/oregon-covid-19) contains charts about Covid-19 spread during the start of the pandemic; I wanted to know more about how the virus was spreading near me.
- [Weather](https://github.com/wpbSabi/weather) has multiple Historical Weather Data Analysis, mostly with R but also with python. [Democratizing weather data with R](https://towardsdatascience.com/democratizing-historical-weather-data-with-r-cc3c76dde7c5) is a tutorial that I wrote in Towards Data Science that shows how to download US weather data and develops several interesting charts for gardeners or weather geeks.  I wrote more articles about specific weather topics as well, such as the number of consecutive days above 80, 90, 100 degrees in Portland, Oregon ([article](https://towardsdatascience.com/use-itertools-groupby-to-count-consecutive-occurrences-in-python-7bb83248b83e)), and summer nighttime lows temperatures across 26 US cities ([article](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-look-at-summer-nighttime-low-temperatures-across-26-cities-in-the-us-9ea596c5f61f)).
- [Portland Districts](https://github.com/wpbSabi/portland_potential_districts) is a geospatial analysis utilizing census tract data to explore a few districting options for Portland's first potential city council districts.
- [Music](https://github.com/wpbSabi/music) is a simple demonstration of how to use pydub to trim mp3 files. 
- [towardsDS](https://github.com/wpbSabi/towardsDS) only has one jupyter notebook that accompanied an article about presentations with jupyter slides
