### Hi there, I'm Sabi 👋

## I'm a Data Scientist (Operations Researcher) who strives to do good: 
- 🌱 I'm an environmentalist with a concern for sustainable living.
- 🌲 I live in Oregon, also known as heaven ☁️.
- 📓 I started writing for [Towards Data Science](https://sabolch-horvat.medium.com/) on Medium in 2021.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a model with Google's OR-Tools
- 💡 I love learning and sharing. My repositories and the ones I follow are intended for both of those purposes.

## Connect with me: 
- 🐦 On [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tourofdata).
- 😄 Pronouns: he / him / his
- 🌳 Fun fact: My wife and I are gardeners and home orchardists, respectively, and our ducks help with permaculture aspects of our system 🐛🦆🥚.

## Check out my repositories: 
- [Python Optimization](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization) includes supply chain models and the Census project mentioned above.
  - [Oregon Districts](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/oregon_districts) is a project in anticipation of 2020 Census data with an accompanying [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-draw-congressional-districts-in-python-with-linear-programming-b1e33c80bc52)
  - [Supply Chain Models](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/supply_chain_models) include a distibution model, a minimum cost flow model, and a seasonal inventory model
  - [Facility Location](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/facility_location) is a simple supply chain example combining optimization with geospatial visualization of the results
- [Geospatial](https://github.com/wpbSabi/geospatial) is for making maps that tell a story
  - [Covid Deaths](https://github.com/wpbSabi/geospatial/tree/main/one_in_covid_deaths) uses geopandas to make choropleth maps of the World and the US around the time when 1 in 500 people in the US had died due to Covid [(article)](https://sabolch-horvat.medium.com/1-in-500-in-the-us-have-died-from-covid-1-in-1700-in-the-world-have-as-of-september-18th-2021-c0de1bf37028)
  - [Montavilla](https://github.com/wpbSabi/geospatial/tree/main/montavilla) displays folium capabilities while exploring grocery store locations in East Portland
- [Weather](https://github.com/wpbSabi/weather) includes Historical Weather Data Analysis with R; see my Towards Data Science [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/democratizing-historical-weather-data-with-r-cc3c76dde7c5).
- [Oregon Covid-19](https://github.com/wpbSabi/oregon-covid-19) contains additional charts about Covid-19 from when I wanted to know more about how the virus was spreading near me.
- [Basketball](https://github.com/wpbSabi/basketball) is a R shiny app that I built to automate the analysis I typically do to guess with my March Madness picks. Additional analysis showed that my methods are not great at guessing the winners, but whose methods are?  I shared this capability in an [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-r-shiny-app-i-built-to-streamline-march-madness-predictions-e5e00c3a3691) as well.
- [Oregon Voters](https://github.com/wpbSabi/oregon_voters) was some ad hoc analysis, with both R and Python, before the 2020 election based on voter registration data.  I tried to understand how things may or may not change in the local state elections.
- [Ducks](https://github.com/wpbSabi/ducks) is a brief overview of the eggs that my ducks have laid in their first year, with a GIF.
