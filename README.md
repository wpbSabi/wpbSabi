## Welcome - Check out my github repositories: 
- My most recent project was a [sustainable supply chain template](https://github.com/wpbSabi/sustainable_supply_chain_template) which utilizes geocoding,  geospatial calculations, mapping with folium, and sustainability metrics to create a supply chain template that accounts for both transportation and facility greenhouse gas emissions (rather than only one or the other).
- [Seasonal Inventory](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/seasonal_inventory) is a multi-period inventory model with capacity constraints. The model utilizes ortool pywraplp.
- [Facility Location](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/facility_location) is a simple supply chain example combining optimization with geospatial visualization of the results
- [Minimum Cost Flow](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/minimum_cost_flow) is a supply chain model that chooses the optimal transportation lanes
- [Oregon Districts](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/oregon_districts) was a project in anticipation of 2020 Census data.  The project uses python optimization that is explained with an accompanying [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-draw-congressional-districts-in-python-with-linear-programming-b1e33c80bc52)
- [Ducks](https://github.com/wpbSabi/ducks) Data analysis with R about how many eggs our ducks have laid in their two years
- [Portland Districts](https://github.com/wpbSabi/portland_potential_districts) is a geospatial analysis utilizing census tract data to explore a few districting options for Portland's first potential city council districts
- [Montavilla Grocery Stores](https://github.com/wpbSabi/geospatial/tree/main/montavilla) displays folium's geospatial capabilities while exploring grocery store locations in East Portland
- [Covid Deaths](https://github.com/wpbSabi/geospatial/tree/main/one_in_covid_deaths) uses geopandas to make choropleth maps of the World and the US around the time when 1 in 500 people in the US had died due to Covid [(article)](https://sabolch-horvat.medium.com/1-in-500-in-the-us-have-died-from-covid-1-in-1700-in-the-world-have-as-of-september-18th-2021-c0de1bf37028)
- [Oregon Covid-19](https://github.com/wpbSabi/oregon-covid-19) contains charts about Covid-19 spread during the start of the pandemic; I wanted to know more about how the virus was spreading near me.
- [Weather](https://github.com/wpbSabi/weather) has multiple Historical Weather Data Analysis with R and python. [Democratizing weather data with R](https://towardsdatascience.com/democratizing-historical-weather-data-with-r-cc3c76dde7c5) is a tutorial that I wrote in Towards Data Science that shows how to download US weather data and develops several interesting charts for gardeners or weather geeks.  I wrote more articles about specific weather topics as well, such as the number of consecutive days above 80, 90, 100 degrees in Portland, Oregon ([article](https://towardsdatascience.com/use-itertools-groupby-to-count-consecutive-occurrences-in-python-7bb83248b83e)), and summer nighttime lows temperatures across 26 US cities ([article](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-look-at-summer-nighttime-low-temperatures-across-26-cities-in-the-us-9ea596c5f61f)).
