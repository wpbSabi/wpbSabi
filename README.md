## Hi there, I'm a Data Scientist | Operations Researcher 
- 💡 I enjoy learning and sharing on GitHub and I started writing on Medium / [Towards Data Science](https://sabolch-horvat.medium.com/) 📓 ✏️ 
- 🚚 🚢 I work primarily on supply chain networks, but my github has a more diverse range of interests
- 🌱🌲🌳 My wife and I are gardeners and home orchardists; our ducks also help with permaculture aspects of our system 🐛🦆🥚.

## Check out my repositories: 
- [Python Optimization](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization) includes supply chain models and other optimization models
  - [Oregon Districts](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/oregon_districts) is a project in anticipation of 2020 Census data with an accompanying [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-draw-congressional-districts-in-python-with-linear-programming-b1e33c80bc52)
  - [Seasonal Inventory](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/seasonal_inventory) is a multi-period inventory model with capacity constraints
  - [Facility Location](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/facility_location) is a simple supply chain example combining optimization with geospatial visualization of the results
  - [Minimum Cost Flow](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/minimum_cost_flow) is a supply chain model that chooses the optimal transportation lanes
- Geospatial projects on GitHub include maps with folium, geopandas, plotly, kepler, and/or other packages
  - [Portland Districts](https://github.com/wpbSabi/portland_potential_districts) is an analysis utilizing census tract data to explore a few districting options for Portland's first potential city council districts
  - [Covid Deaths](https://github.com/wpbSabi/geospatial/tree/main/one_in_covid_deaths) uses geopandas to make choropleth maps of the World and the US around the time when 1 in 500 people in the US had died due to Covid [(article)](https://sabolch-horvat.medium.com/1-in-500-in-the-us-have-died-from-covid-1-in-1700-in-the-world-have-as-of-september-18th-2021-c0de1bf37028)
  - [Montavilla Grocery Stores](https://github.com/wpbSabi/geospatial/tree/main/montavilla) displays folium capabilities while exploring grocery store locations in East Portland
- [Weather](https://github.com/wpbSabi/weather) has multiple Historical Weather Data Analysis with R and python
  - See articles on [Towards Data Science](https://medium.com/@sabolch-horvat/about)
  - I plan to update images for Portland, Oregon after the first freeze in 2022
- [Oregon Covid-19](https://github.com/wpbSabi/oregon-covid-19) contains additional charts about Covid-19 from when I wanted to know more about how the virus was spreading near me.
- [Basketball](https://github.com/wpbSabi/basketball) is a R shiny app that I built to automate the analysis I typically do to guess with my March Madness picks. Additional analysis showed that my methods are not great at guessing the winners, but whose methods are?  I shared this capability in an [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-r-shiny-app-i-built-to-streamline-march-madness-predictions-e5e00c3a3691) as well.
- [Ducks](https://github.com/wpbSabi/ducks) is a brief overview of the eggs that my ducks have laid in their first year, with a GIF.
